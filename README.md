There is season.

I am currently an iOS developer.
Anyone familiar with the iOS ecosystem knows the situation. Given my limited talent, I can only broaden my knowledge horizontally across programming languages. The language I use most is Swift, but of course, I also know Objective-C. I have worked on Flutter projects as well. Out of laziness, I learned Python for automation, and I am currently studying Vue and uni-app, aiming to become a full-stack developer!

Don’t ask me why I haven’t learned Android.

A middle-aged homebody.

I once wrote AVG scripts using Kirikiri, but honestly, they were pretty bad, haha.

这里是season。

目前是一名iOS开发程序员。
iOS的情况大家都懂的，加上自己天赋有限，只能横向扩展编程语言知识，目前用的最多的语言是Swift，当然肯定会OC，Flutter项目也写，因为懒，所以也学了Python搞自动化，目前正在学习Vue与uni-app，争取成为大前端！

别问我为啥没学Android。

步入中年的隐宅。

一度用吉里吉里写了AVG脚本，可是还是太烂了，哈哈。
